I am a first-year Ph.D student in [the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/), fortunately advised by [Dr.Xuan Wang](https://xuanwang91.github.io/). I am also a student member of [the Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/) at VT. 

# Recent Activity
- **<font color="#FF0000">I'm actively seeking a PhD position in the US for Spring/Fall 2025.</font>**

# Research Interest
My research lies at the intersection of large language models, information networks and multi-modal data mining. To be more specific, I focus on how to integrate multimodal data and graph structural information into language models for real world problems.
- Graph Foundation Models, Graphs Representation Learning
- Structural Information Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Models
- AI + Medical/Health
